**Analysis of the Relationship Between Wind Speed, Temperature, and Precipitation**

This analysis investigates the relationship between wind speed, temperature, and precipitation to determine whether precipitation is dependent on those weather elements. The study involves correlation analysis, univariate, and multivariate regression models,with and without outliers  to understand the influences of wind speed and temperature on precipitation. 

**Correlation Analysis**

The correlation matrix provides initial insights into the relationships between wind speed, temperature, and precipitation. The correlation between wind speed and precipitation is -0.013, which is very close to zero. This suggests that there is no significant linear relationship between wind speed and precipitation. In terms of temperature and precipitation: The correlation is 0.047, indicating a very weak positive relationship. The correlation is -0.236 between wind and temperature also suggests a weak negative relationship between these two variables.

**Univariate Regression Analysis**

The performance of the univariate models (predicting precipitation using a single feature) is summarized.  When wind speed is applied as a predictor, the R² value (coefficient of determination) is 0.00048 for training and -0.0016 for testing. A near-zero or negative R² means that wind speed does not explain any variance in precipitation. When temperature is applied as a predictor, the R² is also very low (0.0041 for training and -0.0063 for testing), suggesting temperature is also a poor predictor of precipitation. The data used does not contain outliers. when introduced, no significant model improvement is noted.

**Multivariate Regression Analysis**

When both wind speed and temperature are used together as predictors and without outliers, the performance does not change as much. Indeed, the combined model does not improve predictive power significantly, with an R² of 0.0041 for training and -0.0067 for testing. A negative test R² suggests that the model performs worse than simply predicting the mean precipitation.

**Conclusion**

The results indicate that wind speed and temperature have no meaningful impact on precipitation. The correlation is near zero, and the regression models confirm that neither wind speed nor temperature is a strong predictor of precipitation even when outliers are considered. Given these findings, precipitation is not dependent on wind speed and temperature. Exploration of additional meteorological variables, such as humidity or atmospheric pressure may reveal a stronger relationship with precipitation.
